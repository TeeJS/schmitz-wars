extends RefCounted
## backend/Faction.cs - a side in the current match, built from pack data by
## FactionRegistry. No constants: the pack decides how many sides exist and what
## they are called. Identity is by reference - the registry owns one instance per
## id, so `==` works everywhere the C# `==` did.

var DisplayName: String

## never on which faction it is.
