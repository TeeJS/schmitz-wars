# Manual element checklists

This is the Step 3 research ledger for the C# frontend. It compares the manual text and labelled illustrations copied at sync `11c1b36` with the current `sol-conflict-revolution/frontend` implementation. It describes code state; it does not claim runtime verification.

Status legend: **Present** = named element and its interaction are represented; **Partial** = information or interaction exists but differs materially from the manual; **Missing** = the manual element is not represented; **Disabled** = the named control is visible but intentionally unavailable.

## 1. Galaxy Map and Galactic Information Display (GID)

Manual passages: Command Center, PDF pp. 21, 23 and 61–62 (manual pp. 22, 24 and 63–64); GID key and modes, PDF pp. 66 and 69–70 (manual pp. 68 and 71–72). Labelled figures: `manual/ILLUSTRATIONS.md`, figs. 2.3, 2.6, 2.7 and 3.8–3.10.

| Manual element, in the manual's words | C# frontend state |
|---|---|
| “Galaxy Map” in the Command Center | **Present.** `GalaxyMap.cs` supplies clickable system targets over the strategic map. |
| “Galactic Information Display” with the categories “LOYALTY”, “FLEETS”, “PERSONNEL”, “RESOURCES”, “MANUFACTURING”, “DEFENSE” | **Present.** `GidBar.cs` builds all six category buttons from `Gid.Categories`. |
| “Display Off” | **Present.** It is a real selectable GID mode and suppresses the information flare. |
| “Show Legend” icon / GID key | **Partial.** `GidKey.cs` builds a legend and updates it with the selected mode, but `GidBar.cs` creates it automatically as a taskbar-stowed window; the manual's explicit Show Legend control is absent. |
| The key's changing heading, such as “GALACTIC INFORMATION DISPLAY — POPULAR SUPPORT” | **Present.** `Gid.TitleFor(mode)` drives the legend heading. |
| Star “size corresponds to the amount” of the selected information | **Present, stylized.** `GalaxyMap.cs` uses tier-sized `+` flares. This is a text-glyph approximation rather than the manual artwork. |
| Popular-support sizes “LOYAL”, “OBEDIENT”, “DISLOYAL”, “HOSTILE” | **Present.** These are the four loyalty-tier labels in `Gid.cs`. |
| Color key: “RED — Alliance”, “GREEN — Empire”, “BLUE — Neutral”, “GRAY — Unexplored” | **Present.** The faction/unexplored colors are centralized in `Gid.cs` and used by the map and key. |
| Alliance Headquarters marked by a “white star”; only the Alliance player sees the hidden Alliance Headquarters | **Present.** `GalaxyMap.cs` draws the Alliance-HQ burst independently of Display Off and only for the Alliance player. |
| Select a GID category, then select one item from its pull-down list | **Present.** The category buttons open mode menus and set the shared active mode. |
| The GID selection applies to both Galaxy and Sector views | **Present.** Both `GalaxyMap.cs` and `SectorWindow.cs` read `Gid.ActiveMode`. |
| Loyalty: “Popular Support”, “Uprisings” | **Present.** Both modes are defined. |
| Fleets: “Idle Fleets”, “Fleets En Route” | **Present.** Both modes are defined. |
| Personnel: “Idle Personnel”, “Active Personnel” | **Present.** Both modes are defined. |
| Resources: “Mines”, “Refineries”, “Energy”, “Maintenance” | **Present.** All four modes are defined. |
| Manufacturing: “Idle Shipyards”, “Idle Training Facilities”, “Idle Construction Yards”, plus shipyard/training/construction capacity | **Present.** Six manufacturing modes are defined. |
| Defense: “Shield Generators”, “Ion Cannons”, “Laser Batteries”, “LNR Series I”, “Death Star Shields” | **Partial.** All five named choices exist, but `Death Star Shields` currently reports a constant zero; defense visibility uses current exploration rather than the manual's stale-intelligence model. |
| Keyboard shortcuts Alt+1 through Alt+9 for the first nine displayed modes | **Missing.** `UIManager._UnhandledInput` implements Alt+H and Alt+O only; no Alt+1…Alt+9 mappings exist. |
| Click a system on the Galaxy Map to open its Sector/System information | **Present.** Invisible planet buttons provide the click targets. |

Research confidence: **high** for named controls/modes, **medium** for exact visual fidelity because this pass is source inspection rather than a rendered comparison.

## 2. Fleet Window

Manual passages: fleet window overview, PDF pp. 48, 50 and 52 (manual pp. 49, 51 and 53); “Reading the Fleet Window,” PDF pp. 110–111 (manual pp. 112–113); fleet/ship commands and rearranging fleets, PDF pp. 114–123 (manual pp. 116–125). Labelled figures: `manual/ILLUSTRATIONS.md`, figs. 2.45, 2.46, 2.50, 2.54–2.56 and 3.54–3.55.

| Manual element, in the manual's words | C# frontend state |
|---|---|
| Open a fleet by double-clicking the Fleet icon in a system window | **Present.** The sector Fleet corner opens `FleetWindow`; the window lists fleets at that system. |
| “Fleets in System” list and selected fleet name | **Present.** The left column lists fleets; selecting one fills the right side. |
| Four tabs: “Capital Ships”, “Fighters”, “Troops”, “Personnel” | **Present.** All four named tabs are declared in `FleetWindow.tscn` and populated by `FleetWindow.cs`. |
| Capital Ships tab: each ship and the fighters/troops it can carry | **Partial.** Ships are listed, but the manual's carried-versus-capacity figures are not shown beside each ship. |
| Fighters tab: “number of fighter squadrons carried / total fighter capacity” | **Missing.** Fighter rows are listed without the paired carried/capacity total. |
| Troops tab: “number of troop regiments carried / total troop capacity” | **Missing.** Troop rows are listed without the paired carried/capacity total. |
| Personnel tab: characters assigned to the fleet | **Present.** Fleet characters are populated in the Personnel tab. |
| Double-click a ship/fighter/troop/personnel entry to “drill down” to its information | **Partial.** Information is reachable through each row's **Status** command, but the manual's double-click drill-down gesture is not implemented consistently. |
| A fleet or ship “in hyperspace” is shown by moving stars / a glow around its icon | **Partial.** Rows say “Enroute — arrives Day …” and are darkened; the moving-star field and icon glow are absent. |
| “Any time a fleet, or a ship within a fleet, is in hyperspace, it cannot receive orders” | **Present.** Order items are disabled while `Status.Enroute`. |
| Drag ships between fleets; drag a ship to blank space to create/rearrange a fleet | **Present.** Fleet and unit drag/drop paths support detaching, combining, and moving contents. |
| Drag fighters, troops, or characters onto a fleet that can carry them | **Present.** The fleet row accepts character/unit drops and loading logic enforces capacity. |
| Fleet menu: “Move”, “Confirmed Move” | **Present.** Both use target selection; Confirmed Move requests confirmation. |
| Fleet menu: “Planetary Bombardment” → “Target Military Facilities”, “Target Civilian Facilities”, “General Bombardment”, “Destroy System” | **Present.** All four named choices exist, with eligibility and Death Star gates. |
| Fleet menu: “Planetary Assault” | **Present.** It is enabled only when assault conditions permit and resolves through `AssaultManager`. |
| Fleet menu: “Rename” | **Disabled.** The item is visible but no rename implementation exists. |
| Fleet menu: “Encyclopedia” | **Disabled.** The item is visible but no Encyclopedia window exists. |
| Fleet menu: “Status” | **Present.** It opens `FleetStatusWindow`. |
| Fleet menu: “Scrap” and the confirmation “Are you sure you want to scrap the following units?” | **Present.** It opens a confirmation and reports the refined-material return. |
| Built-ship menu: “Move”, “Confirmed Move”, “Create Fleet”, “Rename”, “Encyclopedia”, “Status”, “Scrap” | **Partial.** Move, Confirmed Move, Create Fleet, Status, and Scrap work; Rename and Encyclopedia are visible but disabled. |

Research confidence: **high** for controls and command wiring, **medium** for drag gesture parity because it has not yet been exercised in a running build.

## 3. Create Mission and Mission Status windows

Manual passages: assembling a mission, PDF pp. 100–101 (manual pp. 102–103); mission table, PDF pp. 103–106 (manual pp. 105–108); tracking missions, PDF p. 107 (manual p. 109); persistent missions, PDF p. 108 (manual p. 110). Labelled figures: `manual/ILLUSTRATIONS.md`, figs. 2.34–2.35 and 3.47–3.51.

| Manual element, in the manual's words | C# frontend state |
|---|---|
| Right-click selected character(s) or SpecForces and choose “Mission” | **Present.** Character and eligible unit menus launch mission targeting. |
| “the cursor changes to cross hairs”; select a target system by clicking “any area of blank space” in its window, or select the particular character/facility/unit required | **Present.** `StartMissionTargeting` accepts a system or object target and resolves fleets to their system. |
| “Create Mission” window | **Present, simplified.** It is a generated `ConfirmationDialog`, not a dedicated manual-layout scene. |
| Create Mission “Target” field | **Present.** It names the system and, for object-specific missions, the selected person/facility/unit. |
| Create Mission team/agent portraits or names | **Present as text.** The dialog lists the selected team by name rather than using the original portrait treatment. |
| “Select Mission” tab and mission list showing only missions available to that character/SpecForce for that target | **Partial.** The legal-filter behavior is present in an OptionButton, but there is no Select Mission tab or manual-style mission list. |
| “Decoy” tab and assignment of qualified team members as decoys | **Partial.** Decoy checkboxes work and are set before launch, but they are inline rather than on the manual's Decoy tab. |
| “Encyclopedia” control in Create Mission | **Missing.** No Encyclopedia control/window is provided. |
| “Assign” and “Cancel” | **Partial.** ConfirmationDialog provides accept/cancel behavior, but the accept button is not explicitly labelled “Assign” in code. |
| Transit time / units in hyperspace after assignment | **Present.** The dialog reports transit days and launch creates real mission travel time. |
| Double-click the Mission icon to bring up the Mission window | **Present.** The sector Mission corner opens `MissionWindow`. |
| Mission window may contain “more than one mission on a given system” | **Present.** It lists every unfinished player mission against the system and names each team. |
| Separate status for “AGENTS” and “DECOYS” | **Present.** Dedicated tabs/labels separately list operatives and decoys. |
| Mission progress/status, including hyperspace and persistent-mission progress | **Present.** Rows show travel days, attempt count, and Diplomacy support percentage. |
| Moving-star field indicates the mission team is “in hyperspace” | **Partial.** Status text reports “in hyperspace, …d out”; the moving-star visual is absent. |
| Right-click Mission icon: “Status”, “Encyclopedia”, “Abort” (and continue a persistent mission when applicable) | **Partial.** Status and per-mission Abort exist; Encyclopedia is visible but disabled. Persistent missions continue automatically, but there is no separately named Continue command. |
| “you cannot give orders to units in hyperspace” | **Present.** Abort is disabled until the team arrives, both in the icon menu and status rows. |
| Aborting/continuing applies to the selected mission when several share a system | **Present for Abort.** Each Abort entry names its mission/team. Continue is automatic rather than a selectable control. |

Research confidence: **high** for create/status controls and mission-menu wiring, **medium** for original visual arrangement because it has not yet been rendered side by side.

Priority pass delivered first at Lord Vader's request. The remaining fifteen window checklists follow below as the source/manual sweep continues.

## 4. Character Status Window

Manual passages: PDF pp. 40 and 94, 99 (manual pp. 41 and 96, 101); figs. 2.33 and 3.46.

| Manual element | C# frontend state |
|---|---|
| Name; “Commanding”; “Attached”; “Status”; “Force Ranking” | **Present.** The title names the character; all four fields update, including destination/days while in transit and captured/injured/mission states. |
| “Diplomacy Rating”; “Espionage Rating”; “Combat Rating”; “Leadership Rating” | **Present.** Raw ratings are displayed without incorrectly clamping the 0–150+ scale. |
| “R&D Capabilities”: Ship Design, Troop Training, Facility Design, each Yes/No | **Partial.** Capable tracks are listed; incapable tracks collapse to “None” instead of three explicit Yes/No rows. |
| “Possible Command Ranks”: Admiral, General, Commander, each Yes/No | **Partial.** Eligible ranks are listed; the original explicit Yes/No matrix is condensed. |
| Character portrait and Ready / In transit / Captured / Injured icon treatment | **Partial.** A portrait placeholder and status text exist; the manual's artwork/status icons are absent. |
| Status window is modal with its distinct Close button | **Partial.** Close exists, but the scene inherits movable/minimizable `DraggableWindow` behavior rather than the manual's modal behavior. |

Confidence: **high**.

## 5. Unit / Capital Ship Status Window

Manual passages: PDF pp. 113–115 (manual pp. 115–117), figs. 3.61–3.62; fighter and ground-unit status descriptions in the same passage.

| Manual element | C# frontend state |
|---|---|
| Assignment: fleet/attached location and “Status” | **Present.** Attached and Status rows are shown, including transit destination and days. |
| “Maintenance Cost” | **Present.** |
| Capital-ship Capacity: Fighter Squadrons, Trooper Regiments; Embarked: Fighters, Troops, Personnel | **Partial.** Fighter/Troop capacity exists, but the status window does not show the full embarked block or assigned fleet with the manual's grouping. |
| “Ship Damaged: yes/no” and burn-mark graphic | **Missing/partial.** Some current statistics are displayed, but there is no explicit Ship Damaged field or burn-mark rendering. |
| Current:capacity subsystem pairs: Hyperdrive, Hull, Damage Control, Shield Recharge, Maximum Shield, Tractor Beam, Sub-Light Engine, Weapon Recharge | **Partial.** Hyperdrive, hull, shield, and sub-light values exist; Damage Control, Shield Recharge, Tractor Beam, Weapon Recharge and most paired current:max semantics are missing. |
| Maneuverability, Detection Rating, Bombardment Modifier | **Present in simplified form.** |
| Weapon arc ratings by turbo laser / ion cannon / laser cannon × forward / aft / starboard / port | **Missing.** The implementation shows aggregate Laser, Ion Cannon and Torpedoes, not station-by-arc ratings. |
| Fighter “Squadron Size” (12 fighters) and remaining craft | **Partial.** It prints a fixed `12:12`; casualties/current strength are not modelled there. |
| Troop/SpecForce “Attack Strength”, “Defense Strength”, “Bombardment Defense”, “Detection Value” | **Present.** |
| 3D unit model / original unit artwork | **Missing.** The scene contains a `[ 3D Model ]` placeholder. |
| Modal Close behavior | **Partial.** Close exists; movable/minimizable behavior remains. |

Confidence: **high** for fields, **medium** for type-specific manual variants.

## 6. Fleet Status Window

Manual passage: fleet status block documented with fleet movement/command material, PDF pp. 54–55 and 93–95 (manual pp. 55–56 and 95–97); current source also records the photographed original wording.

| Manual element | C# frontend state |
|---|---|
| “Status”; “ETA Destination” as arrival Day N; destination/location | **Present.** ETA is calculated as an absolute game day. |
| “Admiral”; “General”; “Commander” | **Present.** Each independent command post is resolved separately. |
| “Number Of Ships” | **Present.** |
| “Capacity” — Fighter Squadrons, Trooper Regiments | **Present.** Values are summed across ships. |
| “Embarked” — Fighter Squadrons, Trooper Regiments, Personnel | **Present.** |
| “Damaged Ships” | **Partial.** The row exists, but the source notes damage modelling is incomplete and its test is only a proxy. |
| “Hyperdrive Rating” as Yes/No fleet capability | **Present.** |
| Modal status-window behavior | **Partial.** The close control exists, but the common draggable/minimizable chrome differs. |

Confidence: **high**.

## 7. Defense Facility Status Window

Manual passages: production/facility status, PDF pp. 82–85 and 125 (manual pp. 84–87 and 127); figs. 3.28–3.29.

| Manual element | C# frontend state |
|---|---|
| Location; “Status: ACTIVE, UNDER CONSTRUCTION, OR EN ROUTE” | **Partial.** Location and Active/Damaged exist; this window does not represent Under Construction or En Route variants. |
| “Maintenance Cost” in maintenance units | **Present.** Correctly labelled as maintenance, not credits/turn. |
| “Standard Processing Rate” for economic facilities | **Present.** It reports days per refined point. |
| “Weapons Rating” for batteries | **Present.** |
| “Bombardment Value” / per-facility bombardment defense | **Present.** |
| Facility type and level/tier | **Present.** |
| Original facility art/status image | **Partial.** Type glyphs substitute for the original art. |
| Status control for a project reports the day construction finishes | **Missing here.** Build completion is reported in `EconomyWindow` instead. |

Confidence: **medium-high**; the manual defines several facility status variants rather than one universal scene.

## 8. System Defenses Window

Manual passages: PDF pp. 27 and 99, 124–126 (manual pp. 28 and 101, 126–128); figs. 2.13, 3.45 and 3.73.

| Manual element | C# frontend state |
|---|---|
| Five tabs: “Personnel”, “Troops”, “Fighter”, “Planetary Shield”, “Planetary Battery” | **Partial.** Personnel, Troops and Fighters exist, but Shield and Battery are combined into one “Orbital Defenses” tab, yielding four tabs. |
| Personnel contains characters and Special Forces on the system, excluding personnel aboard fleets | **Present.** Own and known enemy personnel are gated and listed; SpecForces are kept out of Troops. |
| Troops contains trooper regiments and “Garrison Requirement” | **Present.** It shows requirement, present count, uprising warning and pending arrivals. |
| Fighter contains squadrons stationed on the system | **Present.** |
| Planetary Shield and Planetary Battery entries, including active/armed/damaged state | **Present but combined.** Both facility types are listed with state in the shared tab. |
| Right-click unit: “Move”, “Confirmed Move”, “Mission”, “Encyclopedia”, “Status”, “Retire” | **Partial.** Move, confirmation, eligible Mission, Status and Retire work; Encyclopedia is named but only logs/has no window. |
| Right-click character: “Move”, “Confirmed Move”, “Mission”, “Command”, “Encyclopedia”, “Status” | **Partial.** Core commands and rank assignment exist; Encyclopedia remains unavailable. |
| Double-click/status gesture for unit detail | **Partial.** Status is reachable from the menu, not consistently through the original double-click. |
| Espionage snapshot / uncertain enemy information | **Present.** Enemy sections use the intel view instead of exposing live state. |

Confidence: **high**.

## 9. Manufacturing and Production / Economy Window

Manual passages: PDF pp. 25–26, 31 and 82–85 (manual pp. 26–27, 32 and 84–87); figs. 2.10–2.12, 2.20 and 3.24–3.29.

| Manual element | C# frontend state |
|---|---|
| Six tabs: “Manufacturing”, “Shipyards”, “Training Yards”, “Construction Yards”, “Refineries”, “Mines” | **Present with one wording change.** The scene says “Training Facilities”; all six functional groups exist. |
| Default Manufacturing tab: “Ship Construction”, “Troops in Training”, “Facilities Under Construction” | **Present.** |
| Each queue's “Destination:” line and current-project progress bar | **Present.** Progress is for the current unit and tooltips report percentage/days. |
| Built : built-plus-under-construction number pair | **Present.** Capacity labels use the manual's `N:N` form. |
| Grayed-out tabs indicate none of that facility type | **Present.** Empty facility tabs are disabled. |
| Built-facility menu: “Encyclopedia”, “Status”, “Scrap” | **Partial.** Status and Scrap work; Encyclopedia is visible but unavailable. |
| Production menu: “Build”, “Stop”, “Destination”, “Rename” (ships only), “Encyclopedia”, “Status”, “Reserved” | **Partial.** Build/Stop/Destination/Status are wired; Rename and Encyclopedia are unavailable; Reserve is implemented for construction yards. |
| Build Selection: item; “Number to build”; “Refined materials necessary”; “Maintenance capacity necessary”; “Best Time To Completion”; “Best Time To Deployment”; Destination; accept/cancel | **Present.** The generated chooser calculates/gates all named fields. |
| Best Time To Completion is an absolute day; Deployment is additional days | **Present.** |
| Completed / under construction / en route use distinct images | **Missing.** Text/status/progress substitute for the original artwork states. |
| Enemy information may be an Espionage snapshot and become stale | **Present.** Intel views gate queues/facilities rather than exposing current state. |

Confidence: **high**.

## 10. Planet / System Data Window

Manual passages: sector-system close-up and economic/defense detail, PDF pp. 24–27 and 48 (manual pp. 25–28 and 49); figs. 2.9–2.13 and 2.47.

| Manual element | C# frontend state |
|---|---|
| System name and control/support information | **Partial.** The window shows name, holder and known support, but its layout is not one of the manual's primary labelled detail windows. |
| Energy and raw-material availability | **Partial.** Base Energy and Materials are text, not the manual's used/available colored bars. |
| Facilities present | **Present as a simple list.** |
| Unexplored system conceals detail | **Present.** It says “Unexplored Planet” and clears resource/facility detail. |
| Unpopulated-system treatment: no facilities/defenses/loyalty bars | **Partial.** The simplified text panel does not reproduce the manual's specific unpopulated artwork/layout. |
| Manual interactions through Manufacturing, Defenses, Fleet and Mission icons | **Missing from this scene.** Those actions live in `SectorWindow`, making `PlanetWindow` an extra simplified view rather than a faithful manual window. |

Confidence: **medium** because the scene has no exact one-to-one manual counterpart.

## 11. Sector Window

Manual passages: PDF pp. 24–25 and 61–62, 68, 85 (manual pp. 25–26 and 63–64, 70, 87); figs. 2.8–2.9 and 3.7, 3.33.

| Manual element | C# frontend state |
|---|---|
| Sector name title and system names colored by control | **Present.** |
| Each system's three bars: energy used/available, mined/raw materials, loyalty | **Present/partial.** The source builds resource/support indicators, but exact art fidelity is unverified. |
| Manufacturing icon; double-click/open Manufacturing and Production | **Present.** |
| Defenses icon at lower left; double-click/open System Defenses | **Present.** |
| Mission icon at lower right, side-attributed; double-click Status and right-click orders | **Partial.** Appearance, Status and Abort are present; Encyclopedia is disabled and no explicit Continue item is offered. |
| Uprising icon at lower right | **Present.** An uprising substitutes a triangle/flame-like marker and warning tooltip. |
| Separate Imperial and Alliance Fleet icons at upper right; open that side's Fleet window | **Present.** Side-specific icons/tooltips are built. |
| Star size follows the current GID mode | **Present, stylized.** A tier-sized `+` glyph is used. |
| Sector window cannot move or minimize; at most two; Close and flip-left/right arrows | **Missing/incorrect.** The scene inherits draggable/minimizable chrome, exposes Minimize, has no flip control, and no two-window invariant is evident. |
| Double-click gesture on detail icons | **Partial.** Buttons open on press; they do not consistently require the manual's double-click. |

Confidence: **high**.

## 12. Personnel Finder

Manual passages: PDF pp. 38, 44 and 96–98 (manual pp. 39, 45 and 98–100); figs. 2.31, 2.39, 3.42–3.43.

| Manual element | C# frontend state |
|---|---|
| “Characters” screen: searchable name list and Alliance / Imperial tabs | **Present.** Search filters live; two side tabs list name and known location. |
| Separate “Character Finder” / “SpecForces Finder” views | **Missing.** Only characters are represented. |
| SpecForces grid: each SpecForce type against each system, searchable by system | **Missing.** |
| Opponent-information warning and stale/unknown intelligence | **Partial.** Intel gating is enforced, but the manual's explicit warning text is absent. |
| “Display” closes finder and opens the system Defense/Fleet/Mission window containing the selection | **Partial.** Clicking a character on a planet opens Defenses; there is no Display button, the finder does not close, and characters aboard fleets only log a TODO. |
| Dagobah/Jabba concealment | **Present.** Off-map characters are omitted. |
| Finder is modal | **Missing/incorrect.** It uses draggable/minimizable common chrome. |

Confidence: **high**.

## 13. Planetary System Finder

Manual passage: PDF p. 73 (manual p. 75), fig. 3.12.

| Manual element | C# frontend state |
|---|---|
| Search/scroll by “System Name” | **Present.** Text filters the lists live. |
| Tabs: “All Systems”, “Rebel Systems”, “Imperial Systems”, “Independent Systems”, “Unexplored Systems” | **Present with terminology differences.** Tabs are All, Alliance, Empire, Neutral, Unexplored; Neutral is the same state the manual also calls Independent. |
| Color-coded systems | **Present.** Buttons use the system faction/exploration color. |
| “Display” or double-click opens the selected system/sector | **Partial.** A single press opens the containing Sector window; there is no explicit Display button or double-click requirement, and selection is sector-level rather than directly focusing the system. |
| Finder is modal | **Missing/incorrect.** Common draggable/minimizable chrome is used. |

Confidence: **high**.

## 14. Confirm Transit Window

Manual passages: movement/“Confirmed Move,” PDF pp. 44–45 and 109–111 (manual pp. 45–46 and 111–113).

| Manual element | C# frontend state |
|---|---|
| Confirmed Move reports “Transit time in days” for the selected person/group | **Present.** It names one character or `N Personnel` and the travel duration. |
| Yes / No confirmation | **Present.** Buttons are labelled `Y` and `N`; Yes executes and No cancels. |
| Modal accept/cancel behavior | **Partial.** It is functionally blocking for the order, but inherits a normal title bar with minimize/close rather than strict modal chrome. |
| If selected personnel cease to be eligible while confirmation is open, do not issue stale orders | **Present.** Refresh removes already-enroute people and closes when none remain. |

Confidence: **high**.

## 15. In-Game Menu / Game Options Window

Manual passages: PDF pp. 28 and 73–75 (manual pp. 29 and 75–77); figs. 2.14 and 3.13–3.16.

| Manual element | C# frontend state |
|---|---|
| Game Options via F1/control strip | **Partial.** This scene is a basic Game Menu, not the manual's Game Options screen. |
| Six save slots with names and side/head-to-head icons; Save/Load/Delete | **Missing.** |
| Sound controls and tactical toggles: Show Starfield, Show Planet, Show Pyrotechnics, Use High Detail Models, Display Holocube | **Missing.** |
| Resume/close | **Present.** “Resume Game” and X close the window. |
| Exit to Main Menu / Exit to Desktop | **Present, extra.** Both controls are wired, though they are not a replacement for manual save/options controls. |

Confidence: **high**.

## 16. Display Message Index / Message Window

Manual passages: PDF pp. 32, 42 and 76–77 (manual pp. 33, 43 and 78–79); figs. 2.23, 2.36–2.38 and 3.18.

| Manual element | C# frontend state |
|---|---|
| Nine categories: “Loyalty”, “Fleet”, “Mission”, “Resource”, “Manufacturing”, “Defense”, “Conflict”, “Chat”, “Advice” | **Present.** Scene tabs map to all nine; plural internal names are retitled for Fleet/Mission where needed. |
| “All Messages,” excluding Agent Advice | **Present.** A generated All tab excludes Advice. |
| Opens on “Agent Advice” after the opening briefing | **Unknown/partial.** Advice exists, but this source pass did not find the startup selection guarantee. |
| Message list plus selected report/detail and portrait | **Partial.** List/detail work; portrait is a placeholder. |
| Posting options / select messages / delete selected | **Present.** Select All and Delete Selected Messages controls are generated. |
| “Go To” associated system | **Present.** Enabled only when the message carries a location. |
| Persistent mission result asks whether to “Continue Mission” or “Abort Mission” | **Present.** Both buttons are generated for applicable reports. |
| Delete individual message | **Present.** |
| Unread/read visual distinction | **Present.** Selected/read messages are recolored. |
| Message windows are modal | **Missing/incorrect.** Common movable/minimizable chrome is used. |

Confidence: **high**.

## 17. Military Data Editor

Manual passage: **none**. This is a developer tool, not a player-facing Rebellion window.

| Manual element | C# frontend state |
|---|---|
| No corresponding manual window/control | **Out of scope for fidelity.** The scene provides a filter, military-unit tree, generated property editor, status label, “Save Changes,” and “Back to Menu.” It should be ported only if developer tooling is intentionally in the 18-scene target. |
| Player access | **Extra/non-manual.** The root menu exposes “View Military Data”; faithful production UI should hide or clearly classify it as tooling. |

Confidence: **high**.

## 18. Shuttle Cockpit / Root Main Menu

Manual passage: PDF p. 20 (manual p. 21), fig. 2.2; save/options elaboration PDF pp. 73–75 (manual pp. 75–77).

| Manual element | C# frontend state |
|---|---|
| New-game difficulty / challenge level | **Present.** Easy, Medium and Hard are exclusive selections; Medium defaults. |
| Galaxy size | **Present.** Small, Medium and Large are exclusive selections; Medium defaults. |
| Choose Alliance/Rebel or Empire/Imperial side | **Present.** Side buttons start the game using pack-order factions. |
| “Headquarters Only Victory” | **Present.** Checkbox feeds game settings. |
| Head-to-head / two-player choice | **Missing.** |
| Load game / six save slots | **Missing.** |
| Exit | **Present.** |
| Shuttle Cockpit artwork and original side/difficulty controls | **Missing.** The scene is a generic “New Game” menu. |
| “View Military Data” | **Extra/non-manual.** Developer-tool entry. |

Confidence: **high**.

## Cross-window fidelity risks

- The 18-scene count is the 16 `frontend/*.tscn` scenes plus root `Main.tscn` and `Menu.tscn`; the Galaxy Map/GID checklist covers `Main.tscn`.
- Most System, Status, Finder and Message scenes inherit `DraggableWindow`, so the manual's modal-vs.-nonmodal rules are not preserved.
- The manual's Window Reference Bar allows twelve minimized System windows; current taskbar behavior should be verified as a separate cross-scene acceptance test.
- Manual double-click gestures are frequently implemented as single button presses. Porting scene structure alone would preserve that mismatch unless gestures are explicitly corrected.
- Encyclopedia controls are repeatedly named but disabled or unwired because no Encyclopedia window exists.

Overall checklist confidence: **high for named fields and code wiring; medium for visual fidelity and runtime gestures pending a rendered/play-tested pass.**
